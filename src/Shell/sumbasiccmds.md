| Topic | Summary |
|    ---   |     ---     |
| 1. [Introducing the Shell](shell.md) | - A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs. <br><br>- This lesson uses Bash, the default shell in many implementations of Unix. <br><br> - Programs can be run in Bash by entering commands at the command-line prompt. <br><br> - The shell’s main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio, its support for automating repetitive tasks, and its capacity to access networked machines. <br><br> - The shell’s main disadvantages are its primarily textual nature and how cryptic its commands and operation can be.| 
| 2. [Navigating File and Directories](fileDir.md) | - The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk. <br><br> - Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders). <br><br> - Directories can also store other directories, which then form a directory tree.<br><br> - `pwd` prints the user’s current working directory. <br><br> - `ls` [path] prints a listing of a specific file or directory; `ls` on its own lists the current working directory. <br><br> - `cd` [path] changes the current working directory.<br><br> - Most commands take options that begin with a single `-`.<br><br> - Directory names in a path are separated with `/` on Unix, but `\` on Windows. <br><br> - `/` on its own is the root directory of the whole file system. - <br><br> - An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system. <br><br> - A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location. <br><br> -  `.` on its own means ‘the current directory’; `..` means ‘the directory above the current one’.|
| 3. [Working with FIles and Directories](create.md)| - `cp` [old] [new] copies a file. <br><br> - `mkdir` [path] creates a new directory. <br><br> - `mv` [old] [new] moves (renames) a file or directory. <br><br> - `rm` [path] removes (deletes) a file. <br><br> - `*` matches zero or more characters in a filename, so `*`.txt matches all files ending in `.txt`. - `?` matches any single character in a filename, so `?.txt` matches `a.txt` but not `any.txt`. <br><br> - Use of the Control key may be described in many ways, including <kbd>Ctrl-X</kbd>, <kbd>Control-X</kbd>, and <kbd>^X</kbd>. <br><br> - The shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it’s really gone.<br><br> - Most files’ names are `something.extension`. The extension isn’t required, and doesn’t guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file. <br><br> - Depending on the type of work you do, you may need a more powerful text editor than Nano.|
| 4. [Pipes and Filter](pipefilter.md)|- `wc` counts lines, words, and characters in its inputs. <br><br> - `cat` displays the contents of its inputs. <br><br> - `sort` sorts its inputs. <br><br> - `head` displays the first 10 lines of its input. <br><br> - `tail` displays the last 10 lines of its input. <br><br> - command `>` [file] redirects a command’s output to a file (overwriting any existing content). <br><br> - `command >> [file]` appends a command’s output to a file. <br><br> - `[first] | [second]` is a pipeline: the output of the first command is used as the input to the second. <br><br> - The best way to use the shell is to use pipes to combine simple single-purpose programs (filters).|
| 5. [Loops](loops.md)| - A for loop repeats commands once for every thing in a list. <br><br> - Every for loop needs a variable to refer to the thing it is currently operating on. <br><br> - Use `$name` to expand a variable (i.e., get its value). `${name}` can also be used. <br><br> - Do not use spaces, quotes, or wildcard characters such as `*` or `?` in filenames, as it complicates variable expansion. <br><br> - Give files consistent names that are easy to match with wildcard patterns to make it easy to select them for looping. <br><br> - Use the up-arrow key to scroll up through previous commands to edit and repeat them. <br><br> - Use <kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd> to search through the previously entered commands. <br><br> - Use `history` to display recent commands, and `![number]` to repeat a command by number.|
| 6. [Scripts](scripts.md)| - Save commands in files (usually called shell scripts) for re-use. <br><br> - `bash [filename]` runs the commands saved in a file. <br><br> - `$@` refers to all of a shell script’s command-line arguments. <br><br> - `$1`, `$2`, etc., refer to the first command-line argument, the second command-line argument, etc. <br><br> - Place variables in quotes if the values might have spaces in them. <br><br> - Letting users decide what files to process is more flexible and more consistent with built-in Unix commands.|
| 7. [Finding Things](find.md)| - `find` finds files with specific properties that match patterns. <br><br> - `grep` selects lines in files that match patterns. <br><br> - `--help` is an option supported by many bash commands, and programs that can be run from within Bash, to display more information on how to use these commands or programs.<br><br> - `man [command]` displays the manual page for a given command. <br><br> - `$([command])` inserts a command’s output in place.|

## Filesystem hierarchy

The following is an overview of a standard Unix filesystem. The exact hierarchy depends on the platform. Your file/directory structure may differ slightly:

## Glossary

#### Absolute Path
- A path that refers to a particular location in a file system. Absolute paths are usually written with respect to the file system’s root directory, and begin with either “/” (on Unix) or “\” (on Microsoft Windows). See also: relative path.

#### argument

- A value given to a function or program when it runs. The term is often used interchangeably (and inconsistently) with parameter.

#### command shell
- See #shell

#### command-line-interface
- A user interface based on typing commands, usually at a [REPL](#repl). See also: [graphical-user-interface](#graphical-user-interface).

#### comment
- A remark in a program that is intended to help human readers understand what is going on, but is ignored by the computer. Comments in Python, R, and the Unix shell start with a `#` character and run to the end of the line; comments in SQL start with `--`, and other languages have other conventions.

#### current working directory
- The directory that relative paths are calculated from; equivalently, the place where files referenced by name only are searched for. Every process has a current working directory. The current working directory is usually referred to using the shorthand notation `.` (pronounced “dot”).

#### file system
- A set of files, directories, and I/O devices (such as keyboards and screens). A file system may be spread across many physical devices, or many file systems may be stored on a single physical device; the operating system manages access.
 
**filename extension**
- The portion of a file’s name that comes after the final `“.”` character. By convention this identifies the file’s type: `.txt` means “text file”, `.png` means “Portable Network Graphics file”, and so on. These conventions are not enforced by most operating systems: it is perfectly possible (but confusing!) to name an MP3 sound file homepage.html. Since many applications use filename extensions to identify the [MIME](#mime-type) type of the file, misnaming files may cause those applications to fail.
  
#### filter
- A program that transforms a stream of data. Many Unix command-line tools are written as filters: they read data from [standard input](#standard-input), process it, and write the result to [standard output](#standard-output).

#### for loop
- A loop that is executed once for each value in some kind of set, list, or range. See also: [while loop](#while-loop).

#### graphical user interface
- A user interface based on selecting items and actions from a graphical display, usually controlled by using a mouse. See also: [command-line interface](#command-line-interface).

#### home directory
- The default directory associated with an account on a computer system. By convention, all of a user’s files are stored in or below her home directory.

#### loop
- A set of instructions to be executed multiple times. Consists of a loop body and (usually) a condition for exiting the loop. See also for [loop](#loop) and [while loop](#while-loop).

#### loop body
- The set of statements or commands that are repeated inside a for [loop](#loop) or [while loop](#while-loop).

#### MIME type
- MIME (Multi-Purpose Internet Mail Extensions) types describe different file types for exchange on the Internet, for example, images, audio, and documents.

#### operating system
Software that manages interactions between users, hardware, and software [processes](#process). Common examples are Linux, macOS, and Windows.

#### option
- A way to specify an argument or setting to a command-line program. By convention Unix applications use a dash followed by a single letter, such as -v, or two dashes followed by a word, such as `--verbose`, while DOS applications use a slash, such as `/V`. Depending on the application, an option may be followed by a single argument, as in `-o /tmp/output.txt`.

#### parameter
- A variable named in a function’s declaration that is used to hold a value passed into the call. The term is often used interchangeably (and inconsistently) with argument.
 
#### parent directory
- The directory that “contains” the one in question. Every directory in a file system except the root directory has a parent. A directory’s parent is usually referred to using the shorthand notation `..` (pronounced “dot dot”).

#### path
- A description that specifies the location of a file or directory within a file system. See also: [absolute path](#absolute-path), [relative path](#relative-path).

#### pipe
- A connection from the output of one program to the input of another. When two or more programs are connected in this way, they are called a “pipeline”.

#### process
- A running instance of a program, containing code, variable values, open files and network connections, and so on. Processes are the “actors” that the operating system manages; it typically runs each process for a few milliseconds at a time to give the impression that they are executing simultaneously.

#### prompt
- A character or characters display by a [REPL](#read-evaluate-print-loop) to show that it is waiting for its next command.

#### quoting
- (in the shell): Using quotation marks of various kinds to prevent the shell from interpreting special characters. For example, to pass the string `*.txt` to a program, it is usually necessary to write it as `'*.txt'` (with single quotes) so that the shell will not try to expand the `*` wildcard.

#### REPL
- (read-evaluate-print loop): A command-line interface that reads a command from the user, executes it, prints the result, and waits for another command.

#### redirect
- To send a command’s output to a file rather than to the screen or another command, or equivalently to read a command’s input from a file.

#### regular expression
- A pattern that specifies a set of character strings. REs are most often used to find sequences of characters in strings.

#### relative path
- A [path](#path) that specifies the location of a file or directory with respect to the current working directory. Any path that does not begin with a separator character (“/” or “\”) is a relative path. See also: [absolute path](#absolute-path).

#### root directory
- The top-most directory in a file system. Its name is “/” on Unix (including Linux and macOS) and “\” on Microsoft Windows.

#### shell
- A command-line interface such as Bash (the Bourne-Again Shell) or the Microsoft Windows DOS shell that allows a user to interact with the [operating system](#operating-system).

#### shell script
- A set of shell commands stored in a file for re-use. A shell script is a program executed by the shell; the name “script” is used for historical reasons.

#### standard input
- A process’s default input stream. In interactive command-line applications, it is typically connected to the keyboard; in a pipe, it receives data from the standard output of the preceding process.

#### standard output
- A process’s default output stream. In interactive command-line applications, data sent to standard output is displayed on the screen; in a pipe `|`, it is passed to the standard input of the next process.

#### sub-directory
- A directory contained within another directory.

#### tab completion
- A feature provided by many interactive systems in which pressing the Tab key triggers automatic completion of the current word or command.

#### variable
- A name in a program that is associated with a value or a collection of values.

#### while loop
- A loop that keeps executing as long as some condition is true. See also: [for loop](#whiel-loop).

#### wildcard
- A character used in pattern matching. In the Unix shell, the wildcard `*` matches zero or more characters, so that `*.txt` matches all files whose names end in `.txt`.
