# Arch for RPI

First thing to note, Arch Linux **doesnâ€™t** support **ARM architecture** (used by devices like Raspberry Pi) officially. But there is a separate project called **Arch Linux ARM** that ports Arch Linux to ARM devices. It is available in both 32-bit & 64-bit format.

Since the installation procedure is purely terminal-based, you will develop an itermediate knowledge of the Linux command line and you should be comfortable in using terminal!
